# Intro to Web Design &amp; Computer Principles | NYU | Spring 2019
## Assignment 8 (Vector Graphics)
This assignment requires that you create an SVG version of a picture of yourself. You’re welcome to take design freedoms as long as your final graphic shows a deep and learned exploration of SVG syntax.

---

## Rules
### Preparing Your Image
1. Choose—or take—an image of yourself with a ratio of `3:4`. Use [this ratio calculator](https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/math/ratios.php) to check the ratio of your image.
1. Settle on an image with a [face-ism ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face-ism) of at least 75% (.75).
2. Resize your image so its `450 × 600`.
3. Name your image `LAST_NAME-FIRST_NAME.jpg`, replacing, of course, `LAST-NAME` and `FIRST-NAME` with your last and first names, respectively.

### Preparing the Scaffold
1. Create a folder called `assignment-8`.
2. Create a file called `style.css` and place it in a folder called `css`, then place `css` inside `assignment-8`.
3. Place `LAST_NAME-FIRST_NAME.jpg` in a folder called `img`, then place `img` inside `assignment-8`.
4. Place your `index.html` file in `assignment-8`.
5. Create a folder called `js`, then create an empty file in `js` called `apps.js`.
6. Move `assignment-8` into the `intro-to-web-design` folder you’ve been working with since the beginning of the semester.

### Preparing the Interaction
1. In `index.html`, create a `div` that is `450 × 600`.
2. Set the image you chose for this project (not the SVG) as the background to the `div`.
3. Place your `svg` element as the only direct child of the `div` element.
4. Create a UI asset (`button`, `a`, etc) that indicates to the user that the background image can be toggled on and off.
5. Use core JavaScript to implement the feature described in step **4**. Place your JavaScript in `app.js`, per the **Preparing the Scaffold** section.

### Creating the SVG
1. You must use, at a minimum, the following SVG elements: `path`, `rect`, `circle`, `ellipse`, and `line`.
2. You must use, at a minimum, 3 colors: one for hair and eyebrows, one for skin color, and one for eyes.
3. Styles associated with the SVG must go in `style.css`.
