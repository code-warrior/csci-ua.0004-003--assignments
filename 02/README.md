# Intro to Web Design &amp; Computer Principles | NYU | Spring 2019
## Assignment 2
This assignment requires that you create a basic, three-page web site about you or someone else, fictitious or real.

## Directions
The three pages you create must be `index.html`, `contact.html`, and `about.html`.

The `index` page should contain some basic information about you/your subject. A paragraph will suffice. It should also contain an image of you/your subject and links to both the `contact` and `about` pages.

The `contact` page should contain a link to an email address, two links to social media platforms, and links back to the `index` page and the `about` page. Choose any social media platforms you please.

The `about` page should extend on the intro content found on the `index` page, perhaps on the order of one or two paragraphs. This page should also contain links back to the `index` and `contact` pages.

## Rules
* All pages must use, at the bare minimum, the following elements: `header`, `nav`, `main`, `p`, `a`, and `img`.
* The `title` and the `meta name="description"` elements must observe the SEO best practices discussed in class during week 3 (see the GitHub repo), and must differ for each of the three pages.
* Your HTML must be valid, per the [w3c-validation](https://atom.io/packages/w3c-validation) Atom package. You may also validate at [http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input](http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input).
* This project must be live at [https://i6.cims.nyu.edu/`~netID`/spring-2019/intro-to-web-design/assignment-2](https://i6.cims.nyu.edu/~netID/spring-2019/intro-to-web-design/assignment-2), where `netID` is your NYU netID.
* Your image must reside in a folder called `img` and must be 1MB or smaller.
* Folders and files must use lowercase, combined with kebab case. For example, `do-this` or `do-this.html`. Further, no spaces in folder or file names (`not this`); no camel case (`notThis`); and, no snake case (`not_this`).
