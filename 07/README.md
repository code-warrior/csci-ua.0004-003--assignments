# Intro to Web Design &amp; Computer Principles | NYU | Spring 2019
## Assignment 7 (Responsive Web Design)
This assignment requires that you revisit the first six assignments and make each page responsive.

---

## Rules
1. Ensure your index page and every single page in each of your first six assignments has the following in the `head`:
```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1">
```
2. Ensure your one or more CSS files is added using the `link` tag with the `media` attribute. For example:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/phone.css" media="(max-width: 400px)">
```
3. Create a break point for desktop in the range of `960` – `1200`.
4. Create a break point for tablet in the range of `768` – `959`.
5. Create a break point for phone in the range of `320` – `767`.
6. Use The [Golden Ratio Typography Calculator](https://grtcalculator.com/) to get an idea on `font-size` and `line-height` values for each break point.
7. A horizontal scroll bar should never be visible when resizing the viewport.
