# Intro to Web Design &amp; Computer Principles | NYU | Spring 2019
## Assignment 5 (Raster Graphics)
This assignment focuses on working with Photoshop to create a collaged image. The scene you create should be fictional in nature. For example, you could create a scene in which a person is having lunch with zombies on a plane with no wings, or one in which a dray of squirrels is dancing the night away at a silent party. 

Pay attention to detail, such as edges, shadows, color, proportions, and composition. Photoshop is powerful in its ability to help with the aforementioned, and Google searches typically yield tutorials created by Adobe, which should be the first links you visit as you seek help online.

Ensure your image is comprised of five different layers, one of which must be a title. The image’s dimensions—in pixels—must be 800 × 600.

## Rules
1. Create a folder called `assignment-5`.
2. If you use CSS, name your style sheet `style.css`, place it in a folder called `css`, then place `css` inside `assignment-5`.
3. Create a folder called `psd` and place it in `assignment-5`.
4. Place your un-flattened `.psd` file in the `psd` folder. 
5. Create a folder called `img` and place it in `assignment-5`.
6. Place a flattened version of your project image in `img`.
7. Write an `index.html` file in which your project file is viewable via the `img` element.
8. Place `index.html` in `assignment-5`.
9. Move `assignment-5` into the `intro-to-web-design` folder you’ve been working with since the beginning of the semester.
10. Upload `assignment-5` to your i6 account.
11. In the top-level navigation of your home page on i6, add a link to your `assignment-5` folder.

**Note**: Folders and files must use lowercase, combined with kebab case. For example, `do-this` or `do-this.html`. Further, no spaces in folder or file names (`not this`); no camel case (`notThis`); and, no snake case (`not_this`).
