# Intro to Web Design &amp; Computer Principles | NYU | Spring 2019
## Assignment 6 (Floating, Positioning, and Backgrounds)
This assignment requires that you revisit assignment 4. You’ll need to use `position` to re-layout the project; include a pull quote or an image that is styled with `float`; use the `background` property to include a hero on at least one page; and, style alternative sections of your site using `background`, like zebra striping. We’ll discuss in class.

---

## Rules
1. Create a folder called `assignment-6`.
2. Place CSS in a folder called `css`, then place `css` inside `assignment-6`.
3. Place images in a folder called `img`, then place `img`inside `assignment-6`.
4. Place `index.html` in `assignment-6`.
5. Move `assignment-6` into the `intro-to-web-design` folder you’ve been working with since the beginning of the semester.
6. Upload `assignment-6` to your i6 account.
7. In the top-level navigation of your home page on i6, add a link to your `assignment-6` folder.

**Note**: Folders and files must use lowercase, combined with kebab case. For example, `do-this` or `do-this.html`. Further, no spaces in folder or file names (`not this`); no camel case (`notThis`); and, no snake case (`not_this`).
