# Intro to Web Design &amp; Computer Principles | NYU | Spring 2019
## Assignment 3
This assignment requires that you use CSS to style the pages you created for assignment 2. Before you proceed, ensure that all the requirements for the second assignment have been met.

## Directions
Use CSS to create a more aesthetically pleasing version of your assignment 2 web site, extending on the basic CSS provided by the browser. You will need to establish a uniform experience across all pages using, at the very least, the following CSS properties: `background`, `font`, `margin`, `padding`, `a:link`, `a:visited`, `a:hover`, `a:active`, and `flex`.

## Setting Up Your Linters
In addition to the `w3c-validation` Atom plug-in, ensure you have the `linter-stylelint` plug-in enabled and that [.stylelintrc.json](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/code-warrior/a766f7c32bab9a82b467601800b00a46/raw/81325ddb58b213bcd73a0487298dbc52e23d015c/.stylelintrc.json) is in your home folder. **Disable the `linter-csslint` Atom plug-in.**

## Setting Up Your Scaffold
1. Create a folder called `assignment-3`.
2. Create a folder called `css` and place it inside `assignment-3`.
3. Create a file called `style.css` and place it in `css`.
4. Place all the HTML files from assignment 2 (`index.html`, `about.html`, and `contact.html`) inside the `assignment-3` folder.
5. Create a folder called `img` and place it in `assignment-3`.
6. Load the one or more images from assignment 2 into the `img` folder.

## Rules
1. Each of the HTML pages must load `style.css` as an external style sheet using the `link` element.
2. Your CSS must be valid, according to the stylelint plug-in.
3. Do not use more than three colors—excluding neutrals—in your designs.
4. Do not use more than two fonts in your designs.
5. Any additional images must be 1MB or smaller and included in the `img` folder.
5. Folders and files must use lowercase, combined with kebab case. For example, `do-this` or `do-this.html`. Further, no spaces in folder or file names (`not this`); no camel case (`notThis`); and, no snake case (`not_this`).
